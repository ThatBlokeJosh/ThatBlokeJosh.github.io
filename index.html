    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p id="meParagraph"> <b>
    Hi, my name is Josh. I am a 16 year-old student from the Czech Republic. <br> 
    I like to code, primarily in Python, but I also know some C# and as you can tell by this page I am currently learning HTML and CSS.<br>
    I am a vivid enjoyer of the linux operating system, and I am currently using Kali linux<br>
    I love games, I own multiple consoles, and a computer. I'm really into older titles, but I also enjoy some newer ones.<br>
    I have recently gotten into reading, some of my favourites are 1984, Animal Farm, and the Hobbit.<br>
    I go to an IT scentered school called Smíchovská střední prumyslová škola, and I am currently in the 1st year of my 4 year course.<br>
    I speak English, Czech, and a little bit of German.<br>
    Some of my other hobbies include: Cycling, hiking, playing chess (I am terrible at chess) and watching films and shows.<br>
    </p>

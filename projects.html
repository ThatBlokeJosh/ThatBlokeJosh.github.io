        <h2>My Projects</h2>

        <p id="meParagraph"><b>I am primarily a Python programmer so all of my projects are naturally in Python.
        <br>
        The library I use the most is Pygame, which is a library for making games in Python.
        <br>
        I first made a little arcade type game, it was very simple, but I was very proud of it.
        <br>
        Recently I made a rock paper scissors game, where I think I made a quite pleasing GUI.
        <br>
        All of my projects and little snippets of code can be found on my Github page.
